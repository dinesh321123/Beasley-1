miniOrange SAML 2.0 Single Sign-On provides SSO to your Wordpress site with any SAML compliant Identity Provider. (ACTIVE SUPPORT for IdP config)

== Description ==

miniOrange SAML 2.0 SSO allows users residing at SAML 2.0 compliant Identity Provider to login to your Wordpress website. We support all known IdPs - Google Apps, ADFS, Okta, Salesforce, Shibboleth, SimpleSAMLphp, OpenAM, Centrify, Ping, RSA, IBM, Oracle, OneLogin, Bitium, WSO2, NetIQ etc.

miniOrange SAML SSO Plugin acts as a SAML 2.0 Service Provider which can be configured to establish the trust between the plugin and various SAML 2.0 supported Identity Providers to securely authenticate the user to the Wordpress site. 

WordPress Multi-Site Environment and ability to configure Multiple IDP's against wordpress as service provider is also supported in premium plugin.

This plugin is also compatible with WordPress OAuth Server plugin. You can now make your WordPress site an OAuth Server and have the users authenticate themselves with your SAML-compliant IDPs like ADFS, Azure AD instead of their WordPress credentials.

If you require any Single Sign On application or need any help with installing this plugin, please feel free to email us at info@miniorange.com or <a href="http://miniorange.com/contact">Contact us</a>.

*	**WordPress Multi-Site Support [Premium]** - Multi-Site environment is one which allows multiple subdomains / subdirectories to share a single installation. With multisite premium plugin, you can configure the IDP in minutes for all your sites in a network. While, if you have basic premium plugin, you have to do plugin configuration on each site individually as well as multiple service provider configuration's in the IDP.

	For Example - If you have 1 main site with 3 subsites. Then, you have to configure the plugin 3 times on each site as well as 3 service provider configurations in your IDP.Instead, with multisite premium plugin. You have to configure the plugin only once on main network site as well as only 1 service provider configuration in the IDP.


*   **Multiple SAML IDPs Support [Premium]** - We now support configuration of Multiple IDPs in the plugin to authenticate the different group of users with different IDP's. You can give access to users by users to IDP mapping (which IDP to use to authenticate a user) is done based on the domain name in the user's email.

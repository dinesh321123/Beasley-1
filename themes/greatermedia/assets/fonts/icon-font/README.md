# Icon Font

To update the icon font, go to the [IcoMoon App](https://icomoon.io/app/) and 
import the selection.json file. This will preserve all the existing icons, class 
names, and character codes. Once you've made changes for the font, make sure you
save the newly generated selection.json to this folder.
